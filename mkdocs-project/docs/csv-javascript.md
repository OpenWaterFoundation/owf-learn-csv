* [Papa Parse](#papa-parse) - a useful library

## JavaScript Language

**TODO smalers 2017-06-12 need to describe example of how to create and parse CSV using core JavaScript.
No need to provide complete solution but point out basics that illustrate why a library is helpful.**

## Papa Parse

**TODO smalers 2017-06-12 need Kory to fill out**

Provide overview, examples to create and parse CSV, also summaries the issues described in the CSV syntax page,
such as how to deal with missing values, quoted content, etc.  Use section breaks to make readable.
